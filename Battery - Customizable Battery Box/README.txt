Customizable Battery Dispenser by Bradk3 on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4808156

Summary:
I don't know how normal people organize their batteries.  Do normal people "organize" them by dumping them in a big bin along with assorted chargers, plastic bags, and a lint roller?  If so, then I am a normal people.If not?  Well, if not, then this is my ticket to normalcy.  At last.I wanted a slick way to organize and dispense my most often-used batteries.  There are quite a few battery organizers/dispensers on Thingiverse, but none of them quite worked for me.  Either they were too tall for my printer, didn't have the right combination of battery storage, or didn't screw to a wall.So, I decided to make my own.  And so can you!I've included three sample battery dispenser STL files that you're welcome to use directly.  They might work, but they're probably not exactly what you're looking for and you'll likely end up filled with regret when you realize just how much they're not... you.  However, the real beauty of this is that you can use OpenSCAD to create custom battery dispensers until your heart is well and truly contented.  Simply download the (two!) SCAD files that I've uploaded, and open "battery_dispenser.scad" and create you own battery-dispensing monstrosity!(I apologize that this isn't customizable directly through the Thingiverse "Customizer", but my design involves two SCAD files, and the Customizer only supports one.  I could combine them, but that sounds like work...)
