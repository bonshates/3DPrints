LTS Utility for macOS lets you flash your ESP32 or Control Board with the newest version from GitHub. Using the web flasher at https://lts-design.com/pages/software is the preferred way if you're on Windows.

The LTS Control app can be downloaded from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/lts-control/id6742149969). An Android version is in early development. For now, you can use the Web version at the bottom of [this](https://lts-design.com/pages/software) page.
