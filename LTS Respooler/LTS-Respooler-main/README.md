# ⚙️🧵 Welcome to the LTS Respooler GitHub! 🧵⚙️

The LTS Respooler is a compact and slightly over-engineered filament Respooler optimized for Bambu Lab spools. It integrates a filament runout sensor and wireless app-connectivity for ease of use. You can find all the files related to it here. That includes the raw .txt ESP32 Code, the .bin firmware files and the PCB Gerber files.

## ➡️ Upcoming features and files:

- Official attachment for spools bigger than 1 kg
- Respooler Pro beta 3D files (compatible with current PCBs)

## 🚀 Getting started

- All the 3D files can be downloaded and printed from [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/models/448008)
- Assembly Intructions and the Needed Hardware PDF can also be found there
- Most of the Hardware can be ordered from Bambu Lab's Maker's Supply
- Flash the newest firmware version to your ESP32 or Control Board using the [Web Flasher](https://lts-design.com/pages/software)
