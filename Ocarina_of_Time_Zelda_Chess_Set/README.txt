# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Ultimaker
Printer: Ultimaker 3
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2 mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
I printed all models parallel to the build plate with build plate only support under their backs. This proved to be the most reliable and reproducible way to get good quality prints. 

Note: Files have 45 mm bases, which necessitates a chess board of ~15 inch sides,slightly larger than standard. Please scale pieces to your preference/ size of chess board. My custom Zelda chess board can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2702633
