Breadboard Jumper Wire Organizer by ThaiDai on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3145630

Summary:
A simple organizer for my breadboard jumper wires. 3 Types, 10 colors, 30 places.After printing it and sorting the wires into it I was surprised it simply stands - so even reducing the wasted space on my table.In the openscad-file you can change all parameters. I added two small holes on one of the connecting elements so you can attach it to a wall or whatever.11/03/2018: added a holder in the middle and more connectors. Cables are "better" separated now.
